# Node Canvas Clock

[Node Canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) is a Cairo backed Canvas implementation for NodeJS. node-canvas extends the canvas API to provide interfacing with node, for example streaming PNG data, converting to a Buffer instance, etc. 

This example app [implements the live-clock.js](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/tree/v1.x/examples) example, which launches an http server so that the live clock rendering can be viewed in the browser.
